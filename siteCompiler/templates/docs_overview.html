<h1>Japanese Show Graph Documentation</h1>

<p>
  The Japanese Show Graph is a vocabulary similarity network of ~10,900 Japanese TV shows and movies.
  It helps Japanese language learners find content that matches their level and discover a
  "path of least resistance" from easier to harder material within vocabulary domains.
</p>

<h2>How It Works (Summary)</h2>

<p>
  The system analyzes subtitle files from thousands of Japanese shows. Each show's subtitles are
  tokenized into individual words (morphemes) using a Japanese morphological analyzer. The vocabulary
  profile of each show is then compared against every other show using a statistical technique called
  TF-IDF, which emphasizes <em>distinctive</em> vocabulary rather than common words.
</p>
<p>
  Two shows are connected in the graph if they share a significant amount of distinctive vocabulary.
  The strength of the connection reflects how much specialized vocabulary they have in common.
  Shows are then grouped into clusters using community detection, producing emergent vocabulary
  domains like "Medical Drama," "Samurai Period Drama," or "School Life Anime."

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>

<dl class="docs-definitions">
  <dt>Morpheme</dt>
  <dd>
    The smallest meaningful unit in Japanese. The analyzer breaks sentences like
    &#x300C;&#x98DF;&#x3079;&#x305F;&#x304F;&#x306A;&#x3044;&#x300D; into individual morphemes:
    &#x98DF;&#x3079;&#x308B; (to eat), &#x305F;&#x3044; (want), &#x306A;&#x3044; (not).
    Each show's vocabulary is the set of all morphemes found in its subtitles.
  </dd>

  <dt>TF-IDF</dt>
  <dd>
    Term Frequency &ndash; Inverse Document Frequency. A weighting scheme that makes common words
    (like &#x3053;&#x308C;, &#x305D;&#x308C;, &#x3067;&#x3059;) count for almost nothing, while
    rare or specialized words (like medical terminology or samurai-era speech) count for a lot.
    This is what makes the similarity metric meaningful.
  </dd>

  <dt>Cosine Similarity</dt>
  <dd>
    A measure of how similar two vocabulary profiles are, ranging from 0 (completely different)
    to 1 (identical). It compares the <em>direction</em> of two TF-IDF vectors rather than their
    magnitude, so it works regardless of how long a show is.
  </dd>

  <dt>Cluster</dt>
  <dd>
    A group of shows detected by the Leiden community detection algorithm. Clusters emerge from
    vocabulary patterns &mdash; they are <em>not</em> based on human-assigned genres. Shows within
    a cluster share more vocabulary with each other than with shows outside the cluster.
  </dd>

  <dt>Centrality</dt>
  <dd>
    How well-connected a show is to others. Higher centrality means the show shares vocabulary
    with many other shows &mdash; making it a good entry point because the vocabulary you learn
    will transfer widely. Lower centrality means more specialized or isolated vocabulary.
  </dd>
